# BlackJack-Card-Counter
BlackJack card counter for online blackjack play

Simply run the main file, and a GUI will pop up with a calculator-like interface. As you play, 
simply click each card that pops up on the casino table, and the program will keep track of
both the running count and the true count.

The true count in the program is much more accurate than someone calculating it in their head using
approximations of the the amount of decks left. It factors in each card that is taken out of the deck,
so instead of using an integer like 5 decks left, the program uses 5.3727 decks left for example,
leading to a much more accurate result.

Three different counting systems are displayed just to show the difference in their accuracy, 
but use the center one as it is the most accurate.

The colors displayed on the probability output are in relation to how much you should be betting.
The more greener it is (not sure how to define that, but I'm sure you'll get it), the more green
you'll be getting!
